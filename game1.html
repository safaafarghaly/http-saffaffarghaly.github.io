            <b>Cooking Fever</b> is a cooking simulation mobile game developed by Nordcurrent, a Lithuanian game developing and publishing company. In the game, players manage various restaurants by making foods and drinks, serving customers, and earning money. Players need to make some upgrades of their kitchen appliances and interior features in order to clear higher levels.

Since its release in 2014, Cooking Fever has become one of the most popular mobile games, having been cumulatively downloaded more than 100 million times in 2017.[1]

On December 1, 2017, Nordcurrent was partnered with Coca-Cola to release an update where players can sell official Coca-Cola beverages in-game.[2] As of December 4, 2018, all references to Coca-Cola were removed.

On December 4, 2019, the customers were all modified with more animated motion.
